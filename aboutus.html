                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>We in Save The Sealife are on a mission to stop the gradual 
                    increasing pollution that is being inflicted upon the oceans.
                    We plan on solving this problem by making a new kind of plastic
                    which is made in such a way that it tastes gross for all fishes 
                    eating it. And thereby hindering the fishes from eating the polluted 
                    plastic. From this point it would be easier to pick up tha plastic and 
                    pollution without hurting the animals. We believe this will play a part
                    in saving the increasing pollution problems we face today.

                                The drastic reduction in

                                is also an opportunity to
