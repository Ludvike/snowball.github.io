                <p>Over the last years there have been an increasing number
                    of trash and other types of pollution ending up in our oceans,
                    we can no longer brush this under the rug. The problem is real
                    and we have to <br> realize that is has to be fixed. Thats where
                    we step in with innovational ideas that can contribute to 
                    hinder the pollution-levels.

                            Ocean heat is at record
